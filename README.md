# Github GraphQl
This is a github android application clone that uses the github [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) api using the [Apollo Kotlin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/) Graph Ql client

[GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) -> GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. 
GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and 
nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.


## Use
In the NetworkModule replace the Token with your github token
``` kotlin

 private const val BASE_URL = "https://api.github.com/graphql"
 private const val token = "GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"

```

## Project setup
The Github Qraph Ql schema file and the Queries are already set up. you can find them here:
```
data/src/main/graphql/com/flexcode
```

You can create the ``schema.graphqls`` your self by using the gradlew task command as shown.
Run it on you terminal. Replace the token with your own token.

``` gradle

 ./gradlew :app:downloadApolloSchema --endpoint='https://api.github.com/graphql' --schema=app/data/src/main/graphql/com/flexcode/schema.graphqls --header="Authorization: Bearer GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"

```

## **Tech stack & Libraries üõ†Ô∏èüë®‚Äçüíª**
- [Apollo kotlin](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/) - A strongly-typed, caching GraphQL client for Java and Kotlin multiplatform and is a GraphQL client that generates Kotlin and Java models from GraphQL queries.
 - [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/) - Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and the JVM version of Kotlin's standard library depends on the Java Class Library, but type inference allows its syntax to be more concise
 * [Jetpack Components:](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8O-VBhCpARIsACMvVLOH1satX45o9f4PMQ4Sxr7bG9myl6-KZL9nYda8PJsHV7m2uJL8bzgaAmqiEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    * [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose?gclid=Cj0KCQjwhqaVBhCxARIsAHK1tiMMwHsxQ8Z25jyEdtLha9erq11wROoEfL6RqpGMprgbDTNuMO3_Ri8aAu5EEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) -  Android‚Äôs modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android
    * [View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel)-  store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
    * [Lifecycle]( https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    * [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata.html) - A lifecycle-aware data holder with the observer pattern
    * [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
    * [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.


* [Dagger-Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)- a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project

* [Coroutines](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/coroutines) - a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously
* [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow)- In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.

* [CI/CD](https://codemagic.io/android-continuous-integration/) - Continuous integration systems let you automatically build and test your app every time you check in updates to your source control system. 

* [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - Image Loader library.

 * [Compose Navigation]()
 * [Lottie Animation](https://lottiefiles.com/what-is-lottie) - A Lottie is a JSON-based animation file format that allows you to ship animations on any platform as easily as shipping static assets.
